/**
 * The AWS Provisioner is responsible for provisioning instances on EC2 for use in
 * Taskcluster.  The provisioner maintains a set of worker configurations which
 * can be managed with an API that is typically available at
 * aws-provisioner.taskcluster.net/v1.  This API can also perform basic instance
 * management tasks in addition to maintaining the internal state of worker type
 * configuration information.
 * 
 * The Provisioner runs at a configurable interval.  Each iteration of the
 * provisioner fetches a current copy the state that the AWS EC2 api reports.  In
 * each iteration, we ask the Queue how many tasks are pending for that worker
 * type.  Based on the number of tasks pending and the scaling ratio, we may
 * submit requests for new instances.  We use pricing information, capacity and
 * utility factor information to decide which instance type in which region would
 * be the optimal configuration.
 * 
 * Each EC2 instance type will declare a capacity and utility factor.  Capacity is
 * the number of tasks that a given machine is capable of running concurrently.
 * Utility factor is a relative measure of performance between two instance types.
 * We multiply the utility factor by the spot price to compare instance types and
 * regions when making the bidding choices.
 * 
 * When a new EC2 instance is instantiated, its user data contains a token in
 * `securityToken` that can be used with the `getSecret` method to retrieve
 * the worker's credentials and any needed passwords or other restricted
 * information.  The worker is responsible for deleting the secret after
 * retrieving it, to prevent dissemination of the secret to other proceses
 * which can read the instance user data.
 *
 * @see "[AwsProvisioner API Documentation](https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/core/aws-provisioner/api-docs)"
